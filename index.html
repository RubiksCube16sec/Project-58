    <p>My hobby is solving the rubiks cube. I do it as a challenge. But something comes out with it. It will make your brain and muscle cordiniation more stronger.<br></br>My fastest time is 16 seconds. I use the advanced CFOP method. I like to do it because all I want to do is get faster. I just never get bored of it. My goal is to become the rubiks cube world record holder.</p>
